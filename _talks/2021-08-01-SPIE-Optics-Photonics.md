In this work, we demonstrate that the high-accuracy computation of the continuous 
nonlinear spectrum can be performed by using artificial neural networks. 
We propose the artificial neural network (NN) architecture that can efficiently 
perform the nonlinear Fourier (NF) optical signal processing. The NN consists of 
sequential convolution layers and fully connected output layers. This NN predicts 
only one component of the continuous NF spectrum, such that two identical NNs have to 
be used to predict the real and imaginary parts of the reflection coefficient. To train the 
NN, we precomputed 94035 optical signals. 9403 signals were used for validation and excluded from training. 
The final value of the relative error for the entire validation dataset was less than 0.3%. Our findings highlight 
the fundamental possibility of using the NNs to 
analyze and process complex optical signals when the conventional algorithms can fail to deliver an acceptable result.
