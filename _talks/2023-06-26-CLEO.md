The goal of this study was to explore the use of Gradient Boosting
(GB) technique for nonlinear equalization in optical transmission systems. GB is an ensemble learning method
that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees. In this case, GB is used as a regression model, which
returns the average prediction of the individual trees for nonlinear shift. In practical implementation, the use of
GB can be implemented through the use of pretrained switchers on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)
