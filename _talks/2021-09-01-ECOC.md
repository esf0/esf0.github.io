We demonstrate that neural networks can outperform conventional numerical nonlinear Fourier transform 
algorithms for processing the noise-corrupted optical signal. Applying the Bayesian hyper-parameters optimisation, 
we design the architecture of neural networks capable to compute nonlinear signal spectrum at 
low SNR more accurately than conventional algorithms.
