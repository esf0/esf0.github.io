The performance of modern optical communication
systems is a bottleneck of modern technology, and
to enhance this performance, we must mitigate the linear and nonlinear distortions that occur 
during signal propagation through optical fibers. In recent years,
the advantages of machine learning techniques have
inspired researchers to expand these advantages for
nonlinear equalization. Several works have demonstrated 
the ability of smart equalizers based on neural
networks to "understand" system parameters and predict nonlinear distortions. 
The goal of this study was
to explore the use of Gradient Boosting (GB) technique for nonlinear equalization in optical transmission systems. 
In practical implementation, the use of
GB can be implemented through the use of pretrained
switchers on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)
