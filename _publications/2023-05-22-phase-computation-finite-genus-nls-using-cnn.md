A method is developed to retrieve phase parameters of quasi-periodic finite-genus solutions to the focusing NLS equation using convolutional neural networks. The proposed architecture leverages RH problem data generation and Bayesian optimization to learn a direct map from finite-duration waveforms to the spectral phases.
