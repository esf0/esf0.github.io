The electromagnetic calorimeter of the Belle II detector contains CsI(Tl) crystals of
30 cm length which have been used at the Belle experiment. We measure the light output degradation 
of CsI(Tl) crystals exposed to uniformly distributed absorbed dose. Four Belle typical
crystals with known scintillation characteristics are irradiated with photons at a total dose of about
35 krad. Results show acceptable radiation hardness for the Belle II experiment conditions where
the accumulated dose in crystals could reach 10 krad.
