A neural network architecture is proposed that allows a continuous nonlinear spectrum of optical signals 
to be predicted and an inverse nonlinear Fourier transform (NFT) to be performed for signal modulation. 
The average value of the relative error in predicting the continuous spectrum by the neural network 
when calculating the direct NFT is found to be 2.68×10−3, 
and the average value of the relative error in predicting the signal for the inverse NFT is 1.62×10−4.
