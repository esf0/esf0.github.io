A neural network architecture is proposed to determine the number of solitons generated by random processes 
in optical wavelength-division multiplexed telecommunication systems with QPSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM, and 1024-QAM modulation. 
The dependence of the prediction quality of a 
neural network with a special architecture on the number of soliton 
modes in the signal and the parameters of this signal is studied.
