We demonstrate that neural networks can outperform conventional numerical nonlinear 
Fourier transform algorithms for processing the noise-corrupted optical signal. 
Applying the Bayesian hyper-parameters optimisation, we design the architecture of 
neural networks capable to compute nonlinear signal spectrum at low SNR more accurately than conventional algorithms.
