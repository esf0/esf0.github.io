This study uses a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to characterize the nonlinear effects in 16-QAM optical systems. 
By analysing signal triplets without noise, the research reveals the limitations of single-Gaussian assumptions and proposes a more expressive probabilistic framework for modeling nonlinear signal behavior.
