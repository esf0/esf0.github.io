Hi, and thank you for visiting my personal webpage!
I'm an AI consultant and applied researcher with a strong focus on practical and innovative applications of artificial intelligence. My work spans across intelligent interactive systems, voice technologies (speech recognition, synthesis, and voice activity detection), educational AI agents, and large-scale data processing using smart bots. I also have extensive experience in 3D scanning and metrology, including developing advanced software for precision measurement systems.

Whether you're exploring AI-driven solutions, looking for technical guidance, or simply curious about my work, you're welcome to reach out through the contact links provided. I'm always open to interesting conversations and meaningful collaborations.

Research & Projects
======

AI Agents for Education and Interaction

More recently, I’ve been involved in the design and implementation of AI agents tailored for educational environments. These systems include role-playing NPCs that simulate complex social interactions to enhance learning outcomes. I have developed interactive dialogue systems combining language models, voice interfaces, and scenario management.


Smart Bots & Big Data

I’ve also worked on AI-powered agents for automation and data processing at scale. This includes building bots capable of extracting, filtering, and analysing large datasets, as well as providing intelligent responses or predictions based on the processed data.


Voice Technologies

My experience extends into voice-based systems, where I’ve built pipelines integrating speech-to-text (STT), text-to-speech (TTS), and voice activity detection (VAD). These components have been deployed in real-time applications requiring responsive, human-like communication capabilities.


3D Scanning and Metrology

With extensive hands-on experience in 3D scanning, I specialise in metrology workflows, geometric processing, and precision measurement systems. I’ve developed software and QA tools for various stages of the scanning pipeline, including calibration, verification, and analysis.


Optical Telecommunications Research

During my PhD at the Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies (UK), I conducted research in advanced optical telecommunications. My work focused on the Nonlinear Fourier Transform (NFT) and its applications for signal transmission and restoration in long-haul fibre systems. I also explored the use of neural networks as alternatives to NFT, with an emphasis on improving data modulation formats and signal robustness using machine learning techniques such as deep learning and regression forests.
