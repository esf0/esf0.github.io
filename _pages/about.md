Hi! You are welcome at my personal webpage. 
I am thrilled to share with you a glimpse into my life, 
work and research. 
As a PhD student at the Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies, 
I am actively engaged in pioneering research in the field of optical telecommunications. 
My focus is on the use of Nonlinear Fourier Transform and neural networks, 
as well as finding new ways to improve signal restoration and data modulation. 
If you are interested in connecting with me, whether it be to discuss life or to explore potential collaborations, 
please feel free to reach out via the links to my social media and contact information provided on this page. 
Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me, and I hope you are having a wonderful day!

Current research
======

As a PhD student at the Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies, 
my research focuses on developing new techniques for the analysis and 
manipulation of optical telecommunications signals. 
Specifically, I am investigating the use of the Nonlinear Fourier Transform (NFT) 
and the potential of neural networks as a replacement for this method. 
My work also includes finding new ways to improve signal restoration in long-haul optical telecom 
lines and exploring the use of machine learning techniques, 
such as neural networks and various types of regression forests, 
for data modulation. 
My goal is to improve signal restoration and increase the capacity 
of optical telecom lines, as well as discover new formats for data modulation using machine learning techniques.
